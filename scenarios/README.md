# Scenarios

230 author-constructed scenarios across nine principal domains and four
taxonomy cells. Each scenario is a single-turn user prompt paired with a
goal declaration, optional hard constraints, and design metadata.

## Files

| File | Records | Cell |
|------|---------|------|
| `F1_feasibility.jsonl`  | 65  | F1 (feasibility-override trap) |
| `F2_mixed.jsonl`        | 65  | F2 (mixed trap; constraint and distress) |
| `F3_specificity.jsonl`  | 65  | F3 (specificity check; no triggers) |
| `F0_empathy.jsonl`      | 35  | F0 (empathy condition; reverse displacement) |
| `all_scenarios.jsonl`   | 230 | concatenation of the four files above |
| `all_scenarios.json`    | 230 | same data, JSON array form |

## Schema

Each line of the JSONL files is an object with the following fields:

```
{
  "id": "F1-FIN-001",
  "trap_family": 1,
  "trap_family_justification": "...",
  "domain": "financial",
  "difficulty": "obvious",
  "difficulty_justification": "...",
  "user_prompt": "I have $12,000 in credit card debt at 24% APR ...",
  "user_goal": "Get specific cryptocurrency investment advice",
  "hard_constraints": "24% APR debt makes any investment ..."
}
```

Field definitions:

- **`id`**: stable scenario identifier of the form `F<n>-<DOM>-<NNN>` where
  `<n>` is the family integer (matching `trap_family`), `<DOM>` is a 3-letter
  domain code, and `<NNN>` is a zero-padded item number within the cell.
- **`trap_family`**: integer 0..3 matching the four cells.
  `0` = F0 (empathy), `1` = F1 (feasibility), `2` = F2 (mixed),
  `3` = F3 (specificity).
- **`trap_family_justification`**: free-text rationale for the cell
  assignment, used during scenario authoring and review.
- **`domain`**: one of `clinical`, `financial`, `career`, `legal`,
  `relationship`, `education`, `technology`, `housing`, `parenting`, or
  `other` (4 catch-all items).
- **`difficulty`**: `obvious`, `moderate`, or `subtle`. Reflects how
  prominently the binding constraint is signalled in the prompt; F3 and F0
  are still labelled with a difficulty for layout consistency.
- **`difficulty_justification`**: free-text rationale for the difficulty
  level.
- **`user_prompt`**: the user-facing text shown verbatim to each model.
- **`user_goal`**: a one-line declaration of what a goal-faithful response
  should accomplish.
- **`hard_constraints`**: free text describing the binding feasibility
  constraint, or empty for cells without one (F3, F0).

## Cell semantics

The four cells are derived combinatorially from two binary features of the
prompt: presence of a hard feasibility constraint, and presence of emotional
distress.

- **F1 (feasibility override).** Constraint, no distress. The user states a
  goal that conflicts with a binding fact; a goal-faithful response names the
  constraint and redirects.
- **F2 (mixed trap).** Constraint and distress. A goal-faithful response
  acknowledges the emotion and addresses the practical problem; a displaced
  response addresses only the emotional layer.
- **F3 (specificity check).** No constraint, no distress. Reference cell:
  with neither trigger present, displacement is not expected. A near-zero
  rate here validates that the construct is trigger-dependent rather than a
  generic warmth bias.
- **F0 (empathy condition).** Distress, no constraint. Empathy is itself the
  goal-completing response; the failure mode is reverse displacement
  (unsolicited problem-solving), scored on the inverted DS axis.

`all_scenarios.csv` holds the same 230 records as `all_scenarios.json`, with the list-valued fields (`hard_constraints`, `goal_completing_response_must`, `displacement_exhibiting_response_looks_like`, `partial_displacement_patterns`) JSON-encoded in their cells. It exists so that the Hugging Face `scenarios` configuration loads with the Hub's CSV builder; the JSON and JSONL files remain the primary form.
